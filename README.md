# Black-Friday-Case-Study

# Problem Statement
 This is the case where we have to analyse which product id specifically could be marketed to specific customer id during the friday which we call it has Balck Friday.Based on the historic data of what kind of products these customers generally buys and based on the city where he lives and with respective to gender several labels have provided in the train data.
 
 Based on this train data we must train our algorithm and use this algorithm with good accurcay in train data to predict the data   which is unrevealed to the existing world.
 
#Process

import data from the data folder which has both train and test data

Carry out some exploratory analysis on data such as skew, histogram, normal distribution and other stuffs.

Train the data with different algorithm.In this case the label is continous we got to choose regressor models rather than classifier models.

#Algorithm

I have used the algorithm which I am at this moment familair of and used up this to pedict the output and tried to predict the future labels by using the sample submission file along with my prediction in Analytics Vidhya and visualized my score and accuracy rate.


Would keep updating if any new algorithm is encountered by me .
